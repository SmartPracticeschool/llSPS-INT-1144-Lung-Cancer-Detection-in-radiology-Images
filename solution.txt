This project presents lung cancer detection based on chest CT images using 
CNN. In the first stage, lung regions are extracted from the CT images.The
extracted images are used to train CNN architecture.Then, CNN is used to 
test the patient images. The main objective of this study is to detect 
whether the tumor present in a patientâ€™s lung is malignant or benign a
web application is built which gives the feasibility of uploading the ct
scan image this app is integrated with the model the models detects the 
tumor and prediction is shown on UI.
